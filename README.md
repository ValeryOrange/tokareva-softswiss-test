# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Routing
This project uses `HashRouter` from `react-router-dom` for routing.

## Browser Support
The project utilizes **Container Queries** and the `clamp()` function for responsive design.
As a result, **Internet Explorer 11 and older versions are not supported**.

npm@10.5.0
node@20.12.2

## Available Scripts

### `npm i`

Installs dependencies

### `npm run start`

Runs the Go App locally

### `npm run build` or `npm run predeploy`

Creates production build

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys this application to GitHub Pages and available on [https://valeryorange.github.io/tokareva-softswiss-test/#/](http://ValeryOrange.github.io/tokareva-softswiss-test). Before the command you need to add key "homepage": "https://valeryorange.github.io/tokareva-softswiss-test" so GitHub Pages knows where to deploy it. It is not set permanently because it changes routing in dev build.
